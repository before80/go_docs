# The New Go Developer Network - 新的 go 开发者网络

https://go.dev/blog/go-developer-network

GoBridge Leadership Team
14 March 2019

A sense of community flourishes when we come together in person. As handles become names and avatars become faces, the smiles are real and true friendship can grow. There is joy in the sharing of knowledge and celebrating the accomplishments of our friends, colleagues, and neighbors. In our rapidly growing Go community this critical role is played by the Go user groups.

当我们亲自走到一起的时候，一种社区感就会蓬勃发展。当手柄变成了名字，头像变成了面孔，笑容是真实的，真正的友谊可以增长。在分享知识和庆祝我们的朋友、同事和邻居的成就时，我们会感到快乐。在我们快速发展的Go社区中，Go用户组发挥了这一关键作用。

To better support our Go user groups worldwide, the Go community leaders at [GoBridge](https://gobridge.org/) and Google have joined forces to create a new program called the Go Developer Network (GDN). The GDN is a collection of Go user groups working together with a shared mission to empower developer communities with the knowledge, experience, and wisdom to build the next generation of software in Go.

为了更好地支持我们世界各地的Go用户群，GoBridge和Google的Go社区领导人联合起来创建了一个新的项目，叫做Go开发者网络（GDN）。GDN是一个Go用户团体的集合体，他们带着共同的使命，用知识、经验和智慧赋予开发者社区以建立下一代的Go软件。

We have partnered with Meetup to create our own [Pro Network of Go Developers](https://meetup.com/pro/go) providing Go developers a single place to search for local user groups, events, and see what other Gophers are doing around the world.

我们与Meetup合作，创建了我们自己的Go开发者专业网络，为Go开发者提供了一个单一的地方来搜索当地的用户组和活动，并查看其他Gophers在世界各地的活动。

User groups that join the GDN will be recognized by GoBridge as the official user group for that city and be provided with the latest news, information, conduct policies, and procedures. GDN groups will have Meetup fees paid by the GDN and will have access to special swag and other fun items. Each organizer of a GDN local group will continue to own the group and maintain full admin rights. **If you currently run a user group**, please fill out this [application](https://j.mp/gdn-form) to request to join the GDN.

加入GDN的用户组将被GoBridge认可为该城市的官方用户组，并被提供最新的新闻、信息、行为政策和程序。GDN团体的Meetup费用将由GDN支付，并可以获得特殊的礼品和其他有趣的物品。GDN本地群组的每个组织者将继续拥有该群组并保持完全的管理权。如果您目前正在运营一个用户组，请填写这份申请，申请加入GDN。

We hope you are as excited about the GDN as we are.

我们希望您和我们一样对GDN感到兴奋。
