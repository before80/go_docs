# Share your feedback about developing with Go

[https://go.dev/blog/survey2023-q1](https://go.dev/blog/survey2023-q1)

Alice Merrick, for the Go team
18 January 2023

Happy 2023! For seven years, the Go Team has conducted a regular survey of Go developers. The results of this survey have helped the team plan and prioritize large changes to the Go ecosystem, such as dependency management, vulnerability scanning, and generics. We want Go to be increasingly usable by and useful to developers, and your feedback has been a critical aspect of making that happen.

So here is [the January 2023 edition of the Go Developer Survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bNnbAtFZ0vfRTH8?s=b)! This survey will run through Feb 8th, and we plan to publish anonymous, aggregated results in early March. It should take about 10 minutes to complete, and all questions are optional. Please help to shape Go’s future by sharing your thoughts and experiences.
