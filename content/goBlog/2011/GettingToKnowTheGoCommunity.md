# Getting to know the Go community - 了解 go 社区

> 原文：[https://go.dev/blog/survey2011](https://go.dev/blog/survey2011)

Over the past couple of years Go has attracted a lot of users and contributors, and I’ve had a great time meeting and talking with many of you. However, for every Gopher I know there are dozens I know nothing about. In order to address this imbalance I’ve prepared a survey for Go users everywhere.

在过去的几年里，Go吸引了大量的用户和贡献者，我和您们中的许多人进行了愉快的交流。然而，每一个我认识的Gopher都有几十个我不知道的。为了解决这种不平衡现象，我为各地的Go用户准备了一份调查。

The survey is short. It asks about you, your involvement with Go, and your interest in Go-related events. Among other things, this data will help myself and the rest of the Go team plan future Go events and schedule conference appearances.

这个调查很简短。它询问了您的情况，您对Go的参与，以及您对Go相关活动的兴趣。在其他方面，这些数据将帮助我和Go团队的其他成员计划未来的Go活动和安排会议出场。

Please take a minute to [complete the survey now](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dFdxOTU1Mm92VFA3eHdkekFPamJjUnc6MQ#gid=0).

请现在花一分钟时间完成调查。

谢谢!

Andrew
