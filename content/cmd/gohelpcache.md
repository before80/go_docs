The go command caches build outputs for reuse in future builds. The default location for cache data is a subdirectory named go-build in the standard user cache directory for the current operating system. Setting the GOCACHE environment variable overrides this default,and running 'go env GOCACHE' prints the current cache directory.

The go command periodically deletes cached data that has not been used recently. Running 'go clean -cache' deletes all cached data.

The build cache correctly accounts for changes to Go source files,compilers, compiler options, and so on: cleaning the cache explicitly should not be necessary in typical use. However, the build cache does not detect changes to C libraries imported with cgo. If you have made changes to the C libraries on your system, you will need to clean the cache explicitly or else use the -a build flag (see 'go help build') to force rebuilding of packages that depend on the updated C libraries.

The go command also caches successful package test results. See 'go help test' for details. Running 'go clean -testcache' removes all cached test results (but not cached build results).

The go command also caches values used in fuzzing with 'go test -fuzz', specifically, values that expanded code coverage when passed to a fuzz function. These values are not used for regular building and testing, but they're stored in a subdirectory of the build cache.Running 'go clean -fuzzcache' removes all cached fuzzing values.This may make fuzzing less effective, temporarily.

The GODEBUG environment variable can enable printing of debugging information about the state of the cache:

- GODEBUG=gocacheverify=1 causes the go command to bypass the use of any cache entries and instead rebuild everything and check that the results match existing cache entries.


- GODEBUG=gocachehash=1 causes the go command to print the inputs for all of the content hashes it uses to construct cache lookup keys.

The output is voluminous but can be useful for debugging the cache.

GODEBUG=gocachetest=1 causes the go command to print details of its decisions about whether to reuse a cached test result.
