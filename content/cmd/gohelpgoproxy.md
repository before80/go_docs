A Go module proxy is any web server that can respond to GET requests for URLs of a specified form. The requests have no query parameters, so even a site serving from a fixed file system (including a file:/// URL) can be a module proxy.

For details on the GOPROXY protocol, see https://golang.org/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol.
