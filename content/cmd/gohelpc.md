There are two different ways to call between Go and C/C++ code.

The first is the cgo tool, which is part of the Go distribution. For information on how to use it see the cgo documentation (go doc cmd/cgo).

The second is the SWIG program, which is a general tool for interfacing between languages. For information on SWIG see http://swig.org/. When running go build, any file with a .swig extension will be passed to SWIG. Any file with a .swigcxx extension will be passed to SWIG with the -c++ option.

When either cgo or SWIG is used, go build will pass any .c, .m, .s, .S or .sx files to the C compiler, and any .cc, .cpp, .cxx files to the C++
compiler. The CC or CXX environment variables may be set to determine the C or C++ compiler, respectively, to use.
