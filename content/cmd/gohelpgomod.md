A module version is defined by a tree of source files, with a go.mod file in its root. When the go command is run, it looks in the current directory and then successive parent directories to find the go.mod marking the root of the main (current) module.

The go.mod file format is described in detail at https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-file.

To create a new go.mod file, use 'go mod init'. For details see 'go help mod init' or https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-init.

To add missing module requirements or remove unneeded requirements, use 'go mod tidy'. For details, see 'go help mod tidy' or https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-tidy.

To add, upgrade, downgrade, or remove a specific module requirement, use 'go get'. For details, see 'go help module-get' or https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-get.

To make other changes or to parse go.mod as JSON for use by other tools, use 'go mod edit'. See 'go help mod edit' or https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-edit.
