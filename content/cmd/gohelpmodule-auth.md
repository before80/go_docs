When the go command downloads a module zip file or go.mod file into the module cache, it computes a cryptographic hash and compares it with a known value to verify the file hasn't changed since it was first downloaded. Known hashes are stored in a file in the module root directory named go.sum. Hashes may also be downloaded from the checksum database depending on the values of GOSUMDB, GOPRIVATE, and GONOSUMDB.

For details, see https://golang.org/ref/mod#authenticating.
